# cabal-ast-play
Playing with annotations on experimental cabal AST

This is based on the code @dcoutts has made available at 
http://code.haskell.org/~duncan/cabal-ast-experiment/

An additional experiment is to add annotations using the same technique as in
https://github.com/shayan-najd/NativeMetaprogramming/blob/master/HsSyn/SyntaxProductIndexed.hs,
with the tweaks suggested by @yav
